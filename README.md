# buffalo-downloader
Simple program for speed your download files. 

This is based on the example HTTP of Qt Creator. I improve it by downloading a file in separate chunks (like IDM) and add more fields for user/password; proxy server.

This is just first version so it is buggy as hell (but it works :blush:)
